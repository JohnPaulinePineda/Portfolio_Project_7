This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_7/) explores the best practices when developing and evaluating prognostic models for clinical research. The general requirements for the clinical study were defined including the formulation of the research question, intended application, outcome, predictors, study design, statistical model and sample size computation. The individual steps involved in model development were presented including the data quality assessment, predictor coding, data preprocessing, as well as the specification, selection, performance estimation, performance validation and presentation of the model used in the study. Additional details on model validity evaluation was also provided.
